# TODO

- [ ] Simplify. Send file to backend and retrieve converted file. Remove invisible form logic.
- [ ] Secure. Implement sessions. Currently, any file on the backend server can be retrieved by the client. This includes converted files, putting user data at risk.
- [ ] Implement XML Schema. Not all of the H2K spec is implemented currently. The H2K schema is now known. Generate H2K file from JSON data and schema instead of using EJS templates.
- [ ] Improve test coverage (currently at 0%).
- [ ] Implement translations.
- [ ] Make interface more responsive.
